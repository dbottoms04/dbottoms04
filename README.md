This is a project for CIS2023 Linux Class
This README.md serves the purpose of updating my progress towards the final project of this Linux Class
This project that was asked to be made was a bash script in linux that can count from 1-50.
As of 8/4/2024 I had completed what was asked of me. That being a bash script that can count from 1-50 in a Linux terminal
I also included a counter.sh for linux and a counter.txt so you can see the files contents on a windows computer.
I have no notes for this project, it does what it suppose to, counts from 1-50 and is a bash script for linux.
